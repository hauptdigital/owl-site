      <h3>Tawny owl</h3>
      <p>
        The tawny owl or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl
        commonly found in <strong>woodlands</strong> across much of Eurasia. The
        tawny owl is a member of the genus <em>Strix</em>, that is also the
        origin of the family's name under Linnaean taxonomy. Its underparts are
        pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are either brown or grey.
        Several of the eight recognised subspecies have both.

        This <mark>nocturnal</mark> bird of prey hunts a wide variety of prey
        species, but usually primarily takes small mammals such as rodents.
        Tawny owls usually hunt by dropping from a perch to seize their prey,
        which they typically swallows whole. In more urban areas, its diet
        includes a higher proportion of birds, while in arid subtropics many
        invertebrates such as insects are taken.
