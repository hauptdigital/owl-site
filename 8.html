      <h3>Tawny owl</h3>
      <p>
        The tawny owl or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl
        commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia. The tawny owl is a
        member of the genus Strix, that is also the origin of the family's name
        under Linnaean taxonomy. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and
        the upperparts are either brown or grey. Several of the eight recognised
        subspecies have both. This nocturnal bird of prey hunts a wide variety
        of prey species, but usually primarily takes small mammals such as
        rodents. Tawny owls usually hunt by dropping from a perch to seize their
        prey, which they typically swallows whole. In more urban areas, its diet
        includes a higher proportion of birds, while in arid subtropics many
        invertebrates such as insects are taken.
