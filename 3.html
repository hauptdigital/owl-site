    The tawny owl or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl
    commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia. The tawny owl is a
    member of the genus Strix, that is also the origin of the family's name
    under Linnaean taxonomy. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the
    upperparts are either brown or grey. Several of the eight recognised
    subspecies have both. This nocturnal bird of prey hunts a wide variety of
    prey species, but usually primarily takes small mammals such as rodents.
    Tawny owls usually hunt by dropping from a perch to seize their prey, which
    they typically swallows whole. In more urban areas, its diet includes a
    higher proportion of birds, while in arid subtropics many invertebrates such
    as insects are taken.
